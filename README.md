Tutorials from The Odin Project
In this Odin tutorial I will be working on a basic recipe website.
I will be implementing the skills I have learned thus far from the Odin Project.
I will be using basic git commands from my VSCode terminal to push files to my recipes repository on github.
I will be using the html skills I have learned to build this website project.
